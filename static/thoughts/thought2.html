            <p>
                The further material is far from a comprehensive research.
                I knowingly did not comply with many standards and procedures.
                Therefore, this is meant to be perceived as only a
                light weight exploratory material and nothing more.

            <h2>Motivation and goals</h2>
            <p>
                Many times I heard: "It is good to be among the first but not to be the first when starting a company",
                which makes intuitive sense but sounds a bit arbitrary. Perhaps a relevant research exists,
                I, however, had not been able to find any and have decided to conduct my little study.
            </p>
            <p>The goal for this piece is to shine some light  on the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Does it matter at all when to start a tech company?</p></li>
                <li><p>What is the best time to start a tech company?</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Breaking down the question</h2>
            <p>
                The questions above, in their general forms, are so general and complex that they, most likely, do not have general answers. Let's constrain the questions and perhaps then there is hope.
                First of all, I will be looking at technology-enabled companies. For example, Google (enabled by Internet and computers), same for Facebook, etc.<br>
                Secondly, I would like to make a couple of assumptions about technologies:<br>
                1. Every technology has a finite set of applications<br>
                2. On average, most obvious applications are the once that address bigger problems that exist in larger markets.<br>
                3. Some time is required by society to learn properties of a given technology.<br>
                Thirdly, I must define what does "best time" mean. I will consider the best time to be such a time that will maximize company's success, measured by market cap.

    <div class="section">
        <div class="text" style="position: relative;">

            <h2>From questions to hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                If assumptions 1, 2 and 3 are true, then, when new technology emerges, first there is a learning phase, then the most obvious and the most profitable (assumption 2) applications are exploited, leaving, on average, only niche and less profitable applications.
                This model seems to follow exactly the proverbial "It is good to be among the first but not to be the first.".
                From this, I can construct the following hypothesis:<br>
                H1: It is best to start right after technology's properties are learned.<br>
                There is one remaining issue. To test the hypothesis, I need to identify when technology's properties are determined. In order to do so, I will make an assumption #4: " I assume that on average technology's properties are well learned after it passes innovators stage in technology adoption cycle.".
                This assumption transforms the hypothesis to be:<br><br>
                <b>H1: "Starting a company when enabling technology has passed innovators phase in technology adoption cycle will increase company's future market capitalization."</b><br><br>
                I will be testing it against:<br><br>
                <b>H0: "Enabling technology's adoption phase has no effect on future market capitalization of a company."</b>
            </p>

        <div class="text" style="position: relative;">

            <h2>Testing the hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Strategy</b><br>
                To test H1 and H0, I will use a random sample of 100 companies, selected from 600  publically traded tech companies, which were founded in the US.
                I will group them by computer technology adoption phase during which they were founded and will check if there is any significant difference between average market capitalizations of the groups.<br>
                <b>Methods</b><br>
                I use pseudo-random integer generator from Python library "random" to select 100 random rows from my dataset.
                Dataset obtained from ABC.
                To test if there is any significant difference between market caps of companies founded in different technology adoption stages, I will use one way ANOVA (Analysis of variance) and Turkey-Kramer procedure, to see which pair of groups has a significant difference if any. Selected alpha level is 0.5
                Also, I will present some histograms for purely visual analysis.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                <b>VISUAL</b><br>
                First, let's take a look at how data looks like. Here is our entire sample's histogram.
                (I created this histogram by counting how many companies fit in a particular market-cap-based group).

                <b>Please note</b> that partitions in this plot are
                not equal! Due to a very large variance it is very hard to plot the data as it is, it would
                look something like this --><br>
                As we can see that doesn't look very good, the variance is huge, and for some groups,
                we do not have any data. However, it does make logical sense, only a few companies reach
                exceptionally high valuations, while there are a lot of lower-valued ones.
                So I decided to prettify it using partitioning based on logarithms of the original market caps.

                <b>Now, back on track,</b> this is a plot of mean market cap values for groups
                of companies, that were organized based on computer technology adoption
                phase in which they were founded.
                For example Autodesk was founded when computer
                technology was in its Early adopters phase,
                so I put it into group 2. New Relic was founded during Late adopters phase, I put it in group four, etc.<br><br>
                It looks like there may be something interesting here,
                we can clearly see that 2dn group's average market cap dominates
                other groups'. Now, it's time to test the hypothesis.

                H1: µ1 ≠ µ2 ≠ µ3 ≠ µ4 - Market caps are statistically not equal among all four adoption based company groups.<br>
                The last graph looked promising, however, due to a huge variance, we were not able to reject H0.<br>
                F = 1.14<br>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Even though we can see some hints that there may be a relationship between company's
                founding time and eventual market cap (our measure of success), statistical analysis
                shows that my hypotheses do not hold water.
                However, for me it doesn't make sense, competition alone
                must stifle companies' growth in later adoption stages, we should have
                detected at least some significant effect of that on market cap.
                I think that main reason why I didn't find a
                statistically significant difference between groups' means is in
                this stud's design, and there is still hope to find an effect if design is fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HOW THIS STUDY CAN BE IMPROVED</b><br>
                There are three major ways of how this study can be improved:
                <ul>
                <li><p>Increasing sample size. One of the ways of offsetting
                       a huge variance is to increase a sample size.</p></li>
                <li><p>Excluding the outliers. There are multiple companies
                       that are arguably monopolies in their respective markets e.g.
                       Intuit. Perhaps those can be considered outliers,
                       I can exclude them to decrease variance.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using different groupings (to control for various factors).</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There seem to be statistically significant differences between groups of companies
                if grouped by both market cap and founding adoption phase, instead of only the adoption phase.
                That could mean, perhaps, that there is a large difference between companies' market caps
                rooted solely in the market they operate in, therefore by controlling for it, we make founding
                time's effect visible. Perhaps this will be my next step in this research,
                If this sounds interesting to you, stand by for updates on this website.
